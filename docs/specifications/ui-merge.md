# Visual & Functional Specifications — Person Merge

> Part of the [OxidGene Specifications](README.md).
> See also: [Tree View](ui-genealogy-tree.md) (action picker "Merge with…") · [Person Edit Modal](ui-person-edit-modal.md) · [Settings](ui-settings.md) (potential duplicates tool) · [Data Model](data-model.md) (Person, PersonName, Event, Family)

---

## 1. Overview

The merge flow allows combining two person records that represent the same individual into a single unified record. It is a **multi-step wizard** that guides the user through selecting the duplicate, comparing data side by side, and choosing which values to keep.

The merge flow can be triggered from:

- The [Tree View](ui-genealogy-tree.md) **action picker**: "Merge with…" on a selected person
- The [Settings](ui-settings.md) **Potential Duplicates** tool: "Merge" button on a detected pair

---

## 2. Wizard Steps

```
Step 1: Select          Step 2: Compare          Step 3: Confirm
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│ Search for    │  →    │ Side-by-side │   →     │ Review &     │
│ the duplicate │       │ field picker │         │ confirm      │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘         └──────────────┘
```

The wizard is displayed in a large modal (~900px wide, max-height 90vh). A progress bar at the top indicates the current step. Back navigation is available at each step.

---

## 3. Step 1 — Select Duplicate

### When triggered from the action picker

The source person is already selected (the person on which "Merge with…" was clicked). The user must select the **target person** to merge into.

```

```

- Search uses the same person search as the [tree topbar](ui-genealogy-tree.md), filtered to the current tree
- The source person is excluded from results
- The user selects one person via radio button
- **Next** is disabled until a target is selected

### When triggered from Potential Duplicates

Both persons are pre-selected (source and target). Step 1 is skipped — the wizard opens directly at Step 2.

---

## 4. Step 2 — Compare & Choose

A side-by-side comparison of all fields from both persons. For each field or group of fields, the user chooses which value to keep in the merged result.

### Field comparison rules

| Field type | Selection | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-value fields** (name, gender, dates, places) | Radio: choose A or B | The more complete/precise value is pre-selected (e.g. full date over year-only) |
| **Identical values** | Shown with `═` indicator, no choice needed | Auto-kept |
| **Events** | Checkbox list: keep or discard each | All kept by default. Probable duplicates (same type + similar date) are flagged and the less precise one is unchecked |
| **Family links** | Checkbox list: keep or discard | All kept by default. Conflicting links (e.g. two different spouse sets for the same union) are highlighted in orange |
| **Media** | Checkbox list | All kept by default |
| **Notes** | Checkbox list | All kept by default (concatenated) |

### Conflict detection

When both persons have events of the same type with similar dates (within 1 year), the system flags them as **probable duplicates**:
- A warning icon appears next to the pair
- The less precise entry is unchecked by default
- The user can override by checking both (they will both be kept)

## 5. Step 3 — Review & Confirm

**"Confirm merge"** is styled as a destructive action (orange background, bold text).

---

## 6. Merge Execution

On confirmation:

1. **Person A** (source) is updated with the chosen field values
2. All kept events, media, notes, and citations from Person B are re-linked to Person A
3. All family links from Person B are transferred to Person A (FamilySpouse, FamilyChild)
4. **Person B** is soft-deleted
5. The `PersonAncestry` closure table is recalculated for affected subtrees
6. The modal closes
7. The tree view refreshes, centered on the merged person (Person A)

---

## 7. Edge Cases

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Both persons are in the same family | The merge proceeds; duplicate family links are deduplicated automatically |
| Person B is the current tree root (SOSA 1) | Warning: "This person is the tree root. After merge, Person A will become the new root." |
| Person B has unions that Person A doesn't | All unions are transferred to Person A |
| Merging would create an invalid relationship (e.g. person becomes their own parent) | The merge is blocked with an error message explaining the conflict |

---

## 8. Keyboard & Accessibility

| Key | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Escape` | Close wizard (with confirmation if on step 2 or 3) |
| `Tab` | Navigate between radio buttons / checkboxes |
| `←` / `→` | Switch between A and B for the focused field |
| `Enter` | Proceed to next step |

---

## 9. Responsive

- Below **900px**: the side-by-side comparison in Step 2 switches to a **stacked layout** (Person A fields above, Person B below, with radio buttons between)
- Below **600px**: the wizard modal becomes a full-screen view
